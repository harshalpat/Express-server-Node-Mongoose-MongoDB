# Express-server-Node-Mongoose-MongoDB

This server is running on port 3000, which is further interacting with mongoDB database which is running on localhost port 27017 by default. 
To run this RESTful API, you must run the server first (command 'mongo') to run the mongoDB in background. Then use 'npm start' to run the node module app.js in conFuisonServer.
Now use postman to GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests and perform the appropriate operation.
